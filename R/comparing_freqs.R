#' Fair base call comparisons.
#'
#' DeepSNV calls minority variants according to a plasmid control which means that often the reference bases is the
#' major allele in the sample (but not always). The DeepSNV script provides all alleles present at a variable site.
#' In this data set there is only ever 2 but there could be more. In comparing two samples it is likely that sample 1
#' contains a minority variant at some position that in sample 2 is characterized by only one allele. If the allele in
#'  sample 2 is the plasmid reference allele there will be no record of it in the data frame. This function adds that
#'  data so that it is clear the samples contain the same major allele (or different major alleles if that is the case).
#'  If both samples contain only the major allele and it is the same allele an empty data frame is returned as we are not
#'  interested in cases were the alleles are the same and there is no minor allele.
#'
#'
#'  If there is only one allele but we might expect two given the frequency then we warn the user. This can happen
#'  when one allele is removed because of poor quality. We do not adjust the frequency of the
#'  remaining alleles in this case. If the present allele matches the only allele in the other sample
#'  then the position is removed as the data suggests both samples have only one allele and
#'  the same allele (at that).
