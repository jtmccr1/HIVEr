\title{Fair base call comparisons.}
\usage{
equal_compare(position)
}
\arguments{
\item{position}{A data frame containing one row for each base called at a loci for the two samples in question.}
}
\value{
A data frame with either the missing allele updated (in the appropriate sample), the missing allele added as
a new entry in the data frame, or an empty data frame (in the case where the is only one allele and it is fixed in both samples)
}
\description{
DeepSNV calls minority variants according to a plasmid control which means that often the reference bases is the
major allele in the sample (but not always). The DeepSNV script provides all alleles present at a variable site.
In this data set there is only ever 2 but there could be more. In comparing two samples it is likely that sample 1
contains a minority variant at some position that in sample 2 is characterized by only one allele. If the allele in
 sample 2 is the plasmid reference allele there will be no record of it in the data frame. This function adds that
 data so that it is clear the samples contain the same major allele (or different major alleles if that is the case).
 If both samples contain only the major allele and it is the same allele an empty data frame is returned as we are not
 interested in cases were the alleles are the same and there is no minor allele.
