\title{Convert long paired data to short paired data.}
\usage{
short_pairs(df, columns, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with obseravtions to be combined}

\item{columns}{columns to be used in combination. They must exist and new columns
will be made appending 1 and 2 to these names}

\item{...}{unquoted grouping columns}
}
\value{
the a data frame with a row for each pair
}
\description{
This function takes in a data frame containing long paired data with one
row / sample in pair and outputs one row / pair. It is on the user to supply
grouping columns such that only 2 samples will match the groups. (we don't
handled more than 2 cases currently). If there are any columns that contain
data not shared by the sample pair they must be included or removed prior to using
the function
