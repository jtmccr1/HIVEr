\title{Polishing compared frequencies.}
\usage{
polish_freq(df, min_freq, relative)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data frame with columns freq1 and freq2}

\item{relative}{c("freq1","freq2") only look at sites with frequency above 0 at freq1,freq2 or niether.}

\item{...}{the minumun frequency allowed. frequencies below will be set to 0. those above to 1}
}
\value{
a data frame with polymophoric loci
}
\description{
This function polishes a frequency comparision data frame. The output
is a subset  of the initial data frame only containing loci that are
polymorphic given both samples. ie. between the two samples there must be two
nucleotides. This function is needed because there are cases where a major allele
exists but there is not minor allele because of sequencing error. In much of the analysis
we are only interested in polymophisms. This function ensures that is all we observe.
