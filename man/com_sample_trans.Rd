\title{Randomly sample a transmission tibble based on a list
of donors}
\usage{
com_sample_trans(data, runs, SPECIDs, test = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame on which to sample. contains freq1 and freq2}

\item{runs}{The number of times to sample}

\item{SPECIDs}{A list of SPECIDs that can be used as donors}

\item{test}{A boolean switch. If activatve returns a list of 2 tibbles. The first is
the last sample_data tibble the second is the normal output}
}
\value{
a data frame with columns freq1, trial, and probability of transmission.
}
\description{
Each run we will ramdomly choose one of the possible transmission pairs
from data with a donor ENROLLID provided in the list and evalute the probability
of transmission. Smoothing every 2%.
